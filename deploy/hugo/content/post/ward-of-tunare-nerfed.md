* Paladin Ward of Tunare and Shadowknight Banshee Mirror was nerfed. In order for it to proc, you must receive damage exceeding 1/4ths the amount it heals for. This will get another adjustment after testing.
* Working on shifting Change Log to a post-friendly style, on the website, so you can link highlights and categorize them more.
* Did a prep pass of eqcleanup (item cleanup), needs some TLC since some items get removed i dont' want gone like new
* The previous patch is major, still doing work on it.
