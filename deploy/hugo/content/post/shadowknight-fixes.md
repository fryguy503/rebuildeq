* Moved the SHD Guildmaster NPC in Cabilis since lizards are impaired at climbing ladders.
* Magical Card reduced Magic Damage from 5 to 2.
* Changes to Paladin Chosen skill should make it now work.
* Shadowknight Siphon of Death should give mana now instead of remove it.
* Shadowknight Blood Oath and Knights Advantage should be more functional.
* #teleport now reports where you're at if you can teleport there, just not as a clickable link.
* fragments could be looted and not flagged, let me know if you got this bug.
