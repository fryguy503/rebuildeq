+++
* Paladins now have the ability Slayer, instead of Slay Undead, which works on all creatures.
* Shadowknight's Hungering Aura improved from 6% per rank to 10%. Adjusted minimum healing amount logic, and general improvements.
* Shadowknight's Embrace Death healing reduced from 0.5% max hp to 0.1% max hp.
* Druid's Nature's Boon no long has a healing over time component, making it not have stacking issues anymore.
* Ancient and Unadorned drops from Temple of Veeshan are now stackable.
* Fixed a display bug with exp_pool, so that you aren't capped at 21 million exp anymore.
* Halls of Testing was adjusted, the trash mobs had their HP reduced to half, and some creatures hit much harder (and drop armor more often) to spice up the experience.
* Dozekar the Cursed in Halls of Testing has been signifcantly nerfed.
