+++
* Artifact Merchant can now BUY/SELL. Enjoy!
* The Hole no longer needs the old dusty key to get in (well, in theory, this isn't fully tested).
* Druid's Spirit of the Wood was adjusted so duration is caster's level * 6 ticks, e.g. at level 60 it lasts 60 minutes.
* Druid's Spirit of the Wood when maxxed also casts SoW. 
* Druid's Covenant of Spirits mana cost reduced. CoS is now 2% instead of 5% mana.
* Druid's Nature's Boon is now a 20% max hp heal per rank instead of 5%.
* Druid's Nature's Whisper increased mana from 1% to 2% per rank.
* Shadowknight's Bash of Death has had a significant damage boost. Formula is something like, base HT + random(10,58) * rank * Level
* Shadowknight's Blood Oath now grants 2 hand bash at rank 5.
* Shadowknight's blood oath works with 2 hand piercers now.
* Shadowed Man Card drops off Dervishes as well, such as snow dervish in iceclad. (They're invisible, right?)
* Shaman's Ancestral Aid is more in line with Spirit of the Wood, improving it.
* Shaman's Spirit of Speed now works.
* Fixed any usage of "Eligable" to "Eligible"
* Paladin's Knight's Advantage should work with 2 hand piercers now.
