* Added Sebilis as a Hotzone, removed Wakening lands. I'll get more official with hotzones later.
* Trakanon no longer banishes
* Feign death will not get aggro from other allies via the shared aggro mechanic.

Hotzones are planned to cycle more frequently, especially after I get things more figured out.

All death touching mobs and banishing will be nerfed, and likely have their stats adjusted since most were lesser due to the components noted.

Before, when you used feign death, it would fail if another ally was fighting nearby and grouped.
