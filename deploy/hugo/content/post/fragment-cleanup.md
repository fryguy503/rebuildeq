+++
* Added Plane of Hate and Plane of Sky as #teleport destinations. They only appear as options after you collect the proper stone reagents wizards normally needed to teleport there, and will consume reagents on use. #return currently works in the planes however.
* Added a new #toggle command with 3 handy options.
* Improved drop rate of cards. I still need to add functionality to them, KEEP them until then.
* A fragment can drop in Sebilis, however it is much rarer than other fragments.
* A fragment can drop in Lavastorm.
* A fragment can drop in Dreadlands. It is no longer automatically unlocked at level 10.
* #rez, #return, and #buff are more expensive now at 50+, #teleport is still same price.
* When mobs flee, they should be a lot easier to hit.
