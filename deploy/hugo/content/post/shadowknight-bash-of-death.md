* Fixed a bug that was causing zone crashes if you had a heal over time on you after zoning.
* Did a large pass of removing out of era items from drops. They may still linger, obviously #issue out of era items.
* Druid's Nature Boon was nerfed, complete healing every tick was not intended. :P Tweaked the regen per tick on NB to be level * 2, instead of level, with an efficiency based on rank.
* Rogue's Appraisal, Bard's Jonathon's Whistle, and Shaman's Fury all were slightly reduced proc rate and some other sanity checks.
* Shadow Knight's Bash of Death's trigger rate went from 10% max rank to 20% max rank.
* Shadow Knight's Festering Spear got a quad dmg to bonus low chance perk at max rank.
* Fixed encounter MR/DR/CR/FR/PR resist formula (Troll Guards shouldn't be as difficult)
* Fixed encounter AC formula (Troll Guards shouldn't be as difficult)
* Bard's Shield of Notes and Song of Stone should now be unusable when reset.
