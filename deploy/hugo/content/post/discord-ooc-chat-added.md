* Discord <> EQ chat is now available in the OOC channel.
* #buff was nerfed for lower levels, boosted for higher levels. It now is in line with druid buffs of your level-ish. (DS at level 1 still, just not as powerful. Scales as you level). Duration is based on level as well.
* #buff now buffs your pet, too!
* Added experience system. At level 60+ I have code that lets excess EXP overflow into a buffer accessed via #exp. This is in preparation for the potion mechanic. It's still very early testing state.
* Fixed a visual glitch with Appraisal where the buff did not appear.
* Bards have new updated icons for builds.
* If you are set to AFK, encounters will no longer spawn for you until you return.
