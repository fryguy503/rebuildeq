* I did a major code change that may have side effects. If you heal or cast any beneficial effects on an NPC not owned by a player, the spell will instead be applied to you. This means paladins can heal themselves while keeping their enemy targeted.
* Fleeting Fury is now a self only buff, even if the spell gem is red.
* Shadowknight's Aura of Vampirism renamed to Reaper's Strike. It should work now!
* Reduced daily login bonus cooldown from 24 hours to 20 hours.
* Moved Bard's Wish from Virtuoso (16) to Swordsinger (34) final skill. 
* Removed Bard's Double Attack build skill
* Added Bard's Kinsong to Virtuoso final skill.
* Jonathon's Whistling Warsong build bonus now also grants a puma-like DD proc.
* Paladin's Resist temptation changed to Flames of Redemption
* Shaman's Fateseer's Boon renamed from "Fateseelers" and fixed.
* Rogues will now autotrain Backstab, Double Attack, and a few other missed skills when they become available.
* Rogue has the new build skill, Appraisal
* Rogue has the new build skill, Thief's Eyes
* Rogue has the new build skill, Sinister Strikes
* Rogue has the new build skill, Focused Stab
* Rogue has the new build skill, Vital Organs
