* Goblin Card is now a shrink clicky.
* Orcs no longer will drop Goblin Cards.
* Removed Trakanon Idol requirement for Sebilis access. Later I'll write an alternative quest to obtain key since I don't require players to have a tracker.
* Added Shadowed Man Card. (Casts gather shadows). rarity is really rare, as a balancing aspect.
* Shadowknight's Siphon Death skill will also include Vampiric Embrace.
