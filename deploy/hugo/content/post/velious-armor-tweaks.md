* Corroded Armor will become non-lore, as well ancient tarnished etc. However, I plan to remove MQ-ability of them. Part of the experience is farming the items with allies for when it drops, not farming massive loads of it and gearing the entire server. **Once we confirm a fix on Heirlooms, I plan to make them tradable to your alts on your account via shared bank. I won't enable this until some eqemu/master bugs are addressed.**
* Fixed Typo with Jonathon's Whistle (should be Jonthon)
* Jonthon's Whistle will now work with all 3 jonthon songs, instead of just whistling warsong.
* Removed Special Abilities from encounter mobs.
* Howling Stones (Charassis) no longer requires key to enter. Also, zone in is now safer so you can #return.
* Rogue's Vital Organs now has a 10*rank% chance to trigger the damage
* Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar no longer requires a key.
* Level 60's who lose EXP from pool will now see it clearer.
* Level 60's when they die should now be able to use #return
* Siren's Grotto safe point is now on Cobalt Scar side, and is more safe.
* Shadowknight's Blood Oath reduced from 10% per rank to 5% per rank. (After healing effectiveness was removed, it was too good).
* Shadowknight's Bash of Death was way too frequently procing with the new damage, nerfed from 4*rank % to rank %. Damage is still left in tact.
