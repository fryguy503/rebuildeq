* Procs across the board were nerfed to half damage, since they were giving WAAY too much dps before.
* Added #DPS. This command gives you the active DPS dealt to an engaged NPC or player, and also works on corpses.
* Added #toggle fulldps. This will give a report of all dps to a NPC when it dies.
* Added #toggle selfdps. This will give a report of your dps to a NPC when it dies.
* Did a cleanup of #buff, druid buffs, and shaman buffs. they should apply better now.
