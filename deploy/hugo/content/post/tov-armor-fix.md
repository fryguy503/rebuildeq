+++
* Fixed tash to not affect the enchanter
* Druid's Intensity no longer displays negative damage.
* After enchanter was added, a new mana bug came in. We repaired this
* Fixed a lingering bug with Rodcet's Gift that caused players affected to lose their target.
* Cleaned up Delar's quest dialog to be less confusing and more informative.
* If you were removed a spell or skill, typing #builds now will fix any missing spells.
* Added some new kodiaks near Velks of higher level to farm while doing fragment farming later levels.
* Entrap, Leech Touch, Spirit of the Wood, Nature's Boon, Ancestral Aid, ConvergenceSpirits, Hand of Piety, Fading Memories, Spirit Call, Steadfast Servant, Ring Affinity, Teleport Bind, Runes, Siren's Song, Brell's Blessing, Flowing Thought, Intensity of the Resolute, Promise, Focus, Frenzied Burnout all should now properly affect mana (reduction or have a mana cost, based on ability/spell).
* Shaman's Spirit call is castable at level 1 now.
* Mana gains from monk/rogue taps were reduced by 25%.
* Fixed ToV turn ins to give armor and gem rewards properly
* Animations now dynamically raise in level based on level of enchanter.
* Shaman's ancestral aid now includes haste since it was accidentally removed from spellbooks when I stripped enchanter spells.
* enchanter's wandering mind, scryer's bypass, and torment of argli are re-added for backfire.
