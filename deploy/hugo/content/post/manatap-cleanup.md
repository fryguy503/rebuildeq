* Monk's Divine Surge was giving too much mana, fixed to match description. It also now generates hate based on amount of mana given.
* Rogue's Jarring Stab was reducing hate too much. Tweaked from a base (20 * rank) to BS (damage * 0.2 * rank)
* Rogue's untapped potential now generates hate when mana is given.
* Shadowknight's Zevfeer's Feast also generates hate when mana is given.
* Revised unholy focus to use the new #focus mechanic.
* Out of combat was increased significantly.
