+++
* Card Distiller can be purchased from a Shady Swashbuckler to remove cards from augments.
* Magical Card now is usable and has been formed properly.
* When you enter a zone that has fragments to unlock teleports and you have not yet collected it, you now get a message informing you.
* Fixed a bug with Nature's boon where you could click it off prematurely.
* Origin binders in thurg/kael/skyshrine should now actually bind you properly.
* Did another pass of out of era item cleanup.
* Rogue's Sneak Attack is usable from 70%+, instead of 90%+
* The water portion of the Siren's Grotto run is now significantly easier, invisibility is still needed for the tunnel portion after.
* Duelist formula will be getting many tweaks, it's a hard skill to figure out, but if the mob is < 7 levels of you, evasion rate should be better now.
