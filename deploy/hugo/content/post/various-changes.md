* Changed server time zone, this may have side effects, but more likely may resolve the internal time system.
* All build-based procs were changed to only work on primary attacks. This means your proc chances should be reduced, we will be assessing and adjusting proc rates after data.
* Monk's divine surge was temporarily nerfed to 2 * rank mana until I rewrite a new mana regen system for rogue/monk/shd. (Monks became pivotal to end game and is scewing how I am trying to tune epic/tier fights, they'll be nerfed to be easier as I collect data)
* Augmented Retribution now should proc based on description.
* Energy Burn and Lifeflow now works properly.
* Poison and Corruption should now properly add bonus damage
* Mobs that were undertuned in Toxx and other zones have been adjusted to be more in line with rest.
* Shadowknight Lifetap mana cost reduced at 45+
* Fixed Typo with Shield of Nife
* Spirit of Wood no longer cures rez sickness.
* Tier mobs now drop elu, shards, and gems.
* Energy Burn and Lifeflow should now be repaired
* Siphon of Death now does proper mana regeneration.
* Fixed out of ammo message for arrows and throwing to be less weirdly errored
* Shadowknight Sworn Enemy changed from static 100 hate per spell to mana * 2.5 hate.
* Shadowknight Darkness changed from a snare boost to a hate boost for darkness/terror lines.
* Cleaned up Necro descriptions for pet (does not get lifetap at 44) and pact of hate (does dd if no focus set)
