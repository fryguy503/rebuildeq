# Protocol Buffers
sourced from https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases
Using 3.4.0

Use the ../proto/ dir to build protocol buffer changes, additional details in that readme.

run cmake . -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"

for the lib, I took the 3.4.0 copy, cd into the cmake dir, followed the README (kinda a pain since you have to cmake the build dir, then cmake inside the build dir for VS build)
