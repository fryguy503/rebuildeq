* Warsong of Zek is now a raw melee damage boost.
* Changed Cacophony to Blade Dancer.
* Changed Song of Stone to Siren's Song
* Deleted aria of innocent from spells.
* Rodcet's Gift now properly does 2% instead of 2x healing ;)
* Level ups now broadcast across server and into discord.
* Removed Timorous Deep from fragment list, as it does not currently exist.
