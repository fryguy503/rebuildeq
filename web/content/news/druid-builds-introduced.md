* Druid is now in! Note druid is still very touchy and I'll be doing more changes tomorrow night.
* Exp Loss starts at level 10, where before it was level 5
* Dance of Blades and Cacophony are no longer usable after you reset them.
* Froglok encounter is now more rare to happen.
* Veksar, Kurn, and Thurgadinb have safer safe spots.
* Shadowknight Blood Oath healing reduction was removed.
* Veksar, Cazic Thule, Nurga, Droga, Jaggedpine, Paw, ChardokC, SolDungc is now disabled. Until a rebalance happens, it's too powerful.
