* Added a fix related to radiant crystal claiming. Still needs a little more testing, but should be much better. If you allocate a TON of crystals (+1k) and grab it from inventory, for time being, avoid getting stacks exceeding 1k at a time (don't shift+left click, just single left click select 1k). Patches will be in soon to help it more, we're pushing eqemu/master's dev of it. If you exceed 1k (I tested at 50k+) it may turn to just 1. So careful. :)
* Skyshrine, Kael, and Thurgadin armor turn in quests are now in! They do not cost typical gems, instead requiring platinum. Near each major banker of each town is an NPC marked (Armor Quest) NPC as well, who will exchange for all classes. **NOTE: The quests are still a little wonky on hail, may need to /say armor** When you're ready to turn in let me know to babysit in case something goes wrong, but should be ready.
* Near banks of Skyshrine, Kael, and Thurgadin are NPCs who will Origin Bind you as well, if your faction is enough.
