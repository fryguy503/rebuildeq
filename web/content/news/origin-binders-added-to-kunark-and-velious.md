* Overthere, Firiona Vie, Skyshrine, Kael, and Thurgadin are now rested EXP zones if your faction is > dubious.
* Overthere, Firiona Vie, Skyshrine, Kael, and Thurgadin offer Origin Binding features near the banks if your faction > dubious.
* Added a new command, #exp. This is for 60+.
* Bard's Jonathon's Whistle had some typos in the build description (due to me copy pasting shaman description).
* Encounters now respect factions of the encounter triggerer, e.g. if in east commons and you're not glare+ to freeport guards, they will not be an encounter to fight.
* Low level zombies, mummies, etc (lvl 24 and lower) no longer cast disease due to how detrimental it is with the convenience commands.
* Pets also gain #buff effects.
* #encounter now works as an alias for #encounters
* #build now works as an alias for #builds
* #experience now works as an alias for #exp
* #rest now works as an alias for #rested
